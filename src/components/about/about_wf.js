        ocusing on the un-loved, weird, or just plain un-cool. If it has wheels
        and an engine I am probably interested. While motorcycles are my true
        passion; cars, trucks, tractors, go karts and everything in between come
        along with the territory. I enjoy everything from simply exploring and
        documenting finds, detailing, to full blown frame off restorations of
        vehicles others would have given up on a long time ago. I started my
        first restoration, a 1978 International Scout II, at age 13 (with some
        help of course) After completion of that 3 year project I was pretty
        hooked. Now, some 15 or so years later, it is a daily way of life.
