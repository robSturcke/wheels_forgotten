      Focusing on the un-loved, weird, or just plain un-cool. If it has wheels
      and an engine I am probably interested. While motorcycles are my true
      passion; cars, trucks, tractors, go karts and everything in between come
      along with the territory. I enjoy everything from simply exploring and
      documenting finds, detailing, to full blown frame off restorations of
      vehicles others would have given up on a long time ago. I started my first
      restoration, a 1978 International Scout II, at age 13 (with some help of
      course) After completion of that 3 year project I was pretty hooked. Now,
      some 15 or so years later, it is a daily way of life. I do the majority of
      the work myself, including everything from general mechanics, to welding,
      to paint and body work. I work with several local businesses for
      specialized work I canâ€™t do in my own shop. I also buy, sell, and trade,
      the funds of which go directly back into my projects.{" "}
